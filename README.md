![FINAL SCORE](https://i.ibb.co/BzVQWP9/image.png)

## Project Overview
Born2beRoot is a system administration project at 42 School that introduces students to the world of virtualization, system configuration, and basic security policies. The project involves setting up a Virtual Machine running Debian, implementing strict password policies, and configuring various system services.

## Personal Experience
This project was one of my favorites at 42 School! I thoroughly enjoyed diving into system administration and learning about virtualization. The hands-on experience with Linux commands, system configuration, and security implementations was incredibly valuable. Unlike some other projects, I found Born2beRoot to be a smooth journey, allowing me to focus on understanding the concepts rather than struggling with implementation.

## Resources Used
I followed the excellent guide created by Pasquale Rossi, which provided clear and detailed instructions throughout the project:
